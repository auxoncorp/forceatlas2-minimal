# ForceAtlas2 Rust Minimal

A fork of [ForceAtlas2 Rust](https://framagit.org/ZettaScript/forceatlas2-rs)
that compiles on stable Rust.  Supports *only* `f32` type coordinates, and has
dropped all optimizations dependent on nightly Rust.

## Known Issues

These issues were discovered at time of fork, and have yet to be remedied.

* The unit tests do not all pass.
* Not all combinations of features compile cleanly.
* Examples depend on system packages.
